##Who I am
My name is Zheng(Derek)Wang, a student of Academy of Interactive Entertainment(AIE,Sydney).
I am on my 2nd year of game development of programing now. My career goal is to be a game desinger, but
I would like to start from a game dev programmer.

##What this blog does
I have a [blog][] built by Wordpress. It is a fantastic exploring to figure out how to set up Virtual Hosing, Apache,
PHP Admin, MySQL, and Wordpress tamplate. Even now I can recall that how exciting to build my own tiny corner in the internet.
Yes, that is good old days. 
I did not post a lot on that blog, which is sad. The last entry is posted at April 10, 2010. Looks like it is a waste of 
money to keep online, but I just can not abandon my good memory.
Oh, after all of those crap, I should state what "this" blog for. I will post all of my thinking and works relating to my 
study here, including, but not limited to(I fell power from this phrase!) programming, game design, and every thing I learned.
Generally, it is a journal of my study and job.(If I could get a job, fingers crossed.)

##我是谁
我是一名目前正在Academy of Interactive Entertainment(AIE,Sydney)学习游戏开发编程的学生。在开始目前的学业之前，我曾经有过短暂的职业
经历，但是与游戏开发无关。目前我的职业目标是成为一名游戏设计师。但是我希望我能从一名游戏程序员做起。

##为什么有这个博客
我希望通过这个博客记录自己在学习和工作中的感想，并且展示我的所学所作。我还有另外一个利用WordPress和虚拟服务器建立的[博客][]。但是
当我知道github page的便利之后，很像尝试一下利用vim和markdown写博客的便利。于是有了这个新的博客。

一点无关功能的代码。谢谢BeiYuu的慷慨。
